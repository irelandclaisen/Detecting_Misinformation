# Detecting_Misinformation

## Description
In this project, I scrape data from news sites to develop a logistic regression model that can classify news as misinformation or not.  I also found the topics that news clusters.

## Context

By developing this model, we can classify news articles that are likely misinformation and find topics that misinformation clusters on so people can be more informed when consuming news.


## Featured Techniques
 * Feature Engineering
 * Data Visualization
 * Balancing Classes
 * Logistic Regression
 * Unsupervised Learning
 * LDA
 

## Data
Data was taken from kaggle, adfontesmedia.com and data from ASU.


## Model Overview
I ended up using the logisitc regression model for our final model.
